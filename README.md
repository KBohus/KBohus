ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I am Karinna Meinol.<br>
I am currently a Software Engineering student, but in the past I was a Master in Chemistry!<br>
The first programming language I had contact to was Python (initially for data analysis) and now I am deepening my knowledgemnt on it!<br>
However, as for now, I am working with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.<br>
